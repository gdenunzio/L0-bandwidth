This data set accompanies the paper, "Computational Efficiency of Alternative Arterial Offset
Optimization Algorithms" by Christopher M. Day and Darcy M. Bullock, submitted to Transportation
Research Record (Paper No. 11-0181) and to appear in print in 2011.  A reprint of the paper is
included in PDF format.

This data set incldues a KML file that shows the geographic locations of the four intersections used
for the test system in the paper.

The data contains 8 CSV files named after the intersection number (1,2,3,4) and approach
(NB = northbound, SB = southbound).

Each CSV contains four tables that lists the number of detected vechile arrivals, or the status
of effective green, per 1-second bin.


  Table                                                Corresponding Variable
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Probability of Green - Aggregated Distributions      G_{j, \phi, m}

  Vehicle Arrivals - Aggregated Distributions          N_{j, \phi, m}

  Vehicle Arrivals - Cycle by Cycle                    N_{j, \phi, i, m}

  Status of Green - Cycle by Cycle                     G_{j, \phi, i, m}


The aggregated distributions are established separately for each hour in the analysis period.

A cycle length of 114 seconds was used for this Saturday timing plan, which ran from 6:00-22:00,
hence the columns in the each table range from m=0 to m=113.

The first column shows the timestamp for each associated row.  For the aggregated tables, this is
the hour represented by the data.  For the disaggregate data, this first column shows the zero time
at the beginning of each cycle.  The second column shows the hour number for the aggregated data,
while for the disaggregate data it indicates the number of seconds after midnight that the zero time
takes place.

The recommended Excel format for Column 1 is "hh:mm:ss.0".
